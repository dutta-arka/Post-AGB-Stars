MESA MIST tracks are available for any one to download here: https://waps.cfa.harvard.edu/MIST/index.html.

## Basics of MIST Tracks
MIST tracks are of two types:
1. Isochrones (tracks of same mass.
3. Evolutionary tracks of same star.

These tracks can be downloaded in bulk or can be downloaded in a more customized way from https://waps.cfa.harvard.edu/MIST/interp_tracks.html. For our study we use .eep.cmd type tracks. The basic code is in fortran. But the tracks can opned using python (see https://github.com/jieunchoi/MIST_codes.git).

A crude idea of how to handle and tweak these codes are in the MIST.ipynb file.
