Here only the crossmatching of stars from photographic plate to GAIA DR3 stars have been given. Considering:
1. Location in sky by crossnatching and
2. Considering proper motion of ther stars,
 we can crossmatch given NAROO I plate details to the stars

Keep in mind that after using SExtractor zero point cannot be directly calculated, Due the non linearity of the photographic plate one needs to do the color calibration. However a short cut rough approximation could be done by selecting a short cone arround the target stars. If a few of them are not variable and do not eveolve at a rapid rate we can use them.
