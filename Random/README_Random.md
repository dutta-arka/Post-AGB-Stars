## Random Unsuccessful Attempts
A few sets of codes were built to do something (and they do) but failed for some reason, from a lack of data to logical inconsistencies or the ones that have some usage to the project, but I am unsure how to categorise them. It could be used at some point (probably will not). The guidelines for these codes are provided below.

1. Random 13. ipynb is an attempt to fit data points of (bp_rp, and G) to the closest matching stellar evolutionary tracks (based on [Fe/H] ratios and interstellar extinction). The MIST tracks can be used in the MESA MIST tracks folder.
2. Variability.ipynb is a structural code that can be used as a base to understand and look for some variability in a target star. Long-term observations like IRSA and Kepler help. TESS, too, can give some ideas about fluctuations in the stellar flux. However, that will be short-term for most of the stars.
